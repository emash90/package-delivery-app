# Packaroo - Frontend Client

This directory contains the source code for the Packaroo frontend application.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React (with Vite)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit & React Query

## Getting Started

The entire Packaroo application, including this frontend client, is designed to be run via Docker for a consistent development environment.

Please refer to the **[main project README](../../README.md)** for complete setup and usage instructions.

### Standalone Development (Optional)

If you wish to run the client separately from the Docker environment (e.g., for focused UI work), you can do so, provided the backend services are already running.

```bash
# Navigate to the client directory
cd client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```
